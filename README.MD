# React & TypeScript - The Practical Guide  

This is my repository for the course **React & [TypeScript - The Practical Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-typescript-the-practical-guide/).  

## About the Course  
This course covers how to effectively use TypeScript with React to write better, type-safe code with fewer errors. It introduces key TypeScript concepts and demonstrates how to apply them in React projects, from basic components to advanced patterns.  

### What the course covers:    
- Why TypeScript is beneficial for React projects.  
- Key TypeScript concepts for React and general development.  
- Using TypeScript with React components, state, and more.  
- Advanced patterns for dynamic and polymorphic components.  
- Type-safe usage of React's Context API and `useReducer()`.  
- Data fetching and `useEffect()` with TypeScript.  
- Type-safe integration with Redux.  

This repository will contain my notes, code, and exercises as I progress through the course.
